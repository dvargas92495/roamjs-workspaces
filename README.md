Create workspaces that you can automatically open with the click of a button.

Define the open|close state of both sidebars, the main window content and the list of pages/blocks to open in the right sidebar if desired.

Create as many workspaces as you like. If you have only one, a button will appear on the Roam Research topbar that will open the workspace. If you have more than one, the button will turn into a dropdown select menu that opens the workspace when you change it.

Once installed, this extension creates a page in your graph called 'Workspaces configuration' and will automatically navigate there. A dummy workspace definition is supplied which demonstrates the required format.

Configuration is simple. In the block indented under Left Sidebar: type either open or closed. Same for Right Sidebar:.

For the Main Window: option, place a page uid in the indented block. For any pages or blocks you want in the right sidebar, create a comma-separated list of uids in the correct spot.

You will need to reload the extension to apply these changes, however a way to do this automatically is on the TODO list.

TODO:
1. apply changes to workspace definitions without reloading the extension
2. Command Palette command to save the current state to a new workspace definition
